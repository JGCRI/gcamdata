#'
#' Read in and process LDS (Land Data System) files.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{object}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA100.0_LDS_preprocessing.R} (aglu level1).
#' @details Read in the various LDS datasets; regularize their column names and
#' GLU (Geographic Land Unit) data; change Taiwan ISO to that of mainland China; make LDS_ag_HA_ha and
#' LDS_ag_prod_t tables consistent. See Di Vittorio, A., P. Kyle, and W. Collins. 2016.

      # when I queried the data four years ago. Alan Di Vittorio has addressed (a); it's now
      # included in the land cover data that's the input to the data system. And, FAOSTAT now
      # includes Taiwan in their various databases. However, the FAOSTAT data currently in the
      # data system was queried in about 2012, and Taiwan was added in 2014, so it's not actually
      # in our level0 data files. As such, we're not yet in a position to add Taiwan as an aglu
      # region. We would need to update our FAOSTAT queries, which will come along with more fun
      # because they've certainly changed country names and quantities (if not the available data
      # altogether). The steps performed here basically re-map the ISO code of Taiwan back to China,

      # totals, but not characteristic variables like vegetative carbon densities).
