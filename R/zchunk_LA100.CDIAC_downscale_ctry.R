#'
#' Combine and downscale (back in time, for USSR and Yugoslavia) the CDIAC emissions and sequestration data.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L100.CDIAC_CO2_ctry_hist}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA100.CDIAC_downscale_ctry.R} (energy level1).
#' @details Combine and downscale (back in time, for USSR and Yugoslavia) the CDIAC emissions and sequestration data.
