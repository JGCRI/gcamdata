#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L108.ag_Feed_Mt_R_C_Y}, \code{L108.ag_NetExp_Mt_R_FodderHerb_Y}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA108.ag_Feed_R_C_Y.R} (aglu level1).
#' @details Computes (1) feed by GCAM commodity, region, and year, and (2) net exports of FodderHerb.
#' The feed calculations combine IMAGE and FAO data together, using FAO to disaggregate IMAGE to GCAM_commodity.
#' Some adjustments are needed to deal with inconsistencies between IMAGE demand & FAO supply.
#' Excess supply is mapped to OtherUses. Excess demand is mapped to other sources (Residue, Pasture).
#' This information is used to calculate net exports of FodderHerb too.

    # 4/12/2019 revision - include DDGS and feedcakes. This is somewhat complicated. FAOSTAT includes oilcrop feedcakes
    # (e.g., soybean, rapeseed) that are co-produced with oils, irrespective of whether the oil is later used to produce
    # biofuels. As such, the secondary output of feed from "biomassOil" is included in the reported oil crop feed
    # numbers. However, DDGS from corn ethanol production are excluded from reported Corn -> Feed in FAOSTAT. For this
    # reason, the methods below treat DDGS and feedcakes differently. Specifically, DDGS and biofuel-related feedcakes
    # are both added as a new source of animal feed, but the biofuel-related feedcakes quantity is deducted from the
    # prior reported oilcrop -> Feed totals.

    # First, determine the oilcrop feedcakes from biofuel production that are tracked as secondary outputs
    # The method assumes that DDGS come from corn, and anything else reported is oilcrop-related.
