#' Generate geothermal (hydrothermal and engineered geothermal systems (EGS)) supply curves by GCAM region
#' Supply curves developed for the 14 GCAM 3.0 regions are downscaled to the country level on the basis
#' of land area, and aggregated to the current GCAM regions. The data source for the supply curves is
#' Hannam et al. 2009: http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19231.pdf
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L116.RsrcCurves_EJ_R_geo}, \code{L116.RsrcCurves_EJ_R_EGS}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA116.geo.R} (energy level1).
#' @details This code chunk assigns geothermal electric resources to GCAM regions. Because the underlying
#' source data were developed for the 14 regions of GCAM 3.0 and prior, they are first
#' downscaled to the nation level on the basis of land area, and aggregated to the current GCAM regions.
