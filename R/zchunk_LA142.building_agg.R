#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L142.in_EJ_R_bld_F_Yh}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA142.building_agg.R} (energy level1).
#' @details  Building sector energy consumption was obtained from end use energy consumption data
#' @details  Fuel inputs to heat were added to building energy use in regions where heat is not modeled as a final fuel
