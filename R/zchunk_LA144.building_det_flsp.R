#' Calculate residential and commercial floorspace - and floorspace prices - by GCAM region and historical year.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L144.flsp_bm2_R_res_Yh}, \code{L144.flsp_bm2_R_comm_Yh}, \code{L144.flspPrice_90USDm2_R_bld_Yh}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA144.building_det_flsp.R} (energy level1).
#' @details Commercial and residential floorspace was calculated at the country level, before aggregating to the regional level.
#' When available, floorspace was calculated from country-specific datasets, including those for the USA, China, and South Africa.
#' Floorspace for countries that did not have country-level data was calculated using GCAM 3.0 assumptions.
#' Floorspace prices were calculated by dividing an assumed fraction of GDP for buildings by residential floorspace.
