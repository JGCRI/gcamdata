#' module_aglu_LB110.For_FAO_R_Y
#'
#' Build FAO forestry production, export, import, and consumption data for every GCAM region in each year.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L110.For_ALL_bm3_R_Y}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LB110.For_FAO_R_Y.R} (aglu level1).
#' @details This module builds Forest Production, Net Export (FAO Exports - FAO Imports), and
#' Consumption  (Production - Net Exports) information for every GCAM region in each year, from
#' FAO Production, Export, and Import data. FAO Production data is used to scale Net Exports
#' at the Region level such that Global Production equals Consumption.
