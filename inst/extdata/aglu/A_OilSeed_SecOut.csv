# Title: Oilseed crushing input-output coefficients (kg crop / GJ oil) and secondary output ratios (kg feedcakes / GJ oil)
# Units: kg / GJ
# Comments: IOcoef: 1 / OilContent * 25.6 kg / GJ. OilContent = 43.4% for Rapeseed, Sunflower, and 18% for Soybean. SecOutRatio = (IOcoef - 25.6 kg/GJ oil) * (1 - losses). Losses = 4% for soybean, 16% for sunflower, 3% for Rapeseed.
