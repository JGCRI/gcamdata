# Title: Various_ag_resbio_data
# Units: Varied see below
# Description: Residue biomass characteristics by crop type
# Harvest Index (unitless): mass of harvested crop divided by total above-ground biomass.
# ErosCtrl (tonnes per hectare): minimum residue required to be left in situ for erosion control.
# ResEnergy (Gigajoules per tonne): energy content of residue biomass at time of harvest
# Root_Shoot (unitless): Mass of roots (below-ground biomass) divided by mass of shoots (above-ground biomass)
# WaterContent (unitless): Water content of aboveground crop biomass
# item and item_code are both updated for primary (land-based) crops; need to include all crops later
# also consider differentiating tree crops later
