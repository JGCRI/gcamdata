# backup.capital.cost: $/kW/yr (amortized capital cost of backup capacity)
# backup.capacity.factor: capacity factor of installed backup
# capacity.limit: renewable share at mid-point of backup capacity requirement s-curve function (i.e., each additional kW of renewable tech requires 0.5 kW of backup capacity here).
