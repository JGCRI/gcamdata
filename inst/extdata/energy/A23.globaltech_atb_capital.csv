# File: A23.globaltech_atb_capital.csv
# Title: Global technologies overnight capital cost by technology and year from NREL 2019 ATB
# Units: $2015/kW for 2015, $2017/kW for other values.
# Source: NREL 2019 Annual Technology Baseline. Medium costs assumed for a given technology. (https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2019/)
# Comments: Technology names are as-is from ATB and require a separate mapping file to ensure that these are mapped to GCAM technologies. All technologies ending with est. are not actually in ATB but estimated based on their relationship with common GCAM-ATB technologies in the older capital cost version.
