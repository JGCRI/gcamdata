# Title: Electricity technology capital costs
# Units: 1975$/kW
# Source: NREL ATB Base Cost Scenario (2019). Improvement rate and improvement max based on 2015 and 2050 values.
# Future improvement is based on the maximum % reduction that the literature deems likely and a rate corresponding to the maturity level of the technology
# Note that some technologies are the same as another with additional equipment (i.e. CCS) for those technologies the improvement is on the additional equipment
