# Title: Raw efficiency estimates (improved).
# Units: Unitless
# Source: Based on existing literature forecasts for coal and gas, ATB numbers beyond the first one are not useful because efficiencies stop improving after 2030. 
# Comments: Technology names are as-is from ATB and require a separate mapping file to ensure that these are mapped to GCAM technologies.
