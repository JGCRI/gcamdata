# Title: Electricity technology retirement parameters
# Units: years for some, unitless for others (see below)
# Source: GCAM assumptions; generally consistent with other models.
# lifetime: maximum equipment lifetime (100% of cohort is retired after this number of years)
# shutdown.rate: Percent per year reduction in output (exponential decay) during lifetime. Uses phased-shutdown-decider function.
# half.life: Number of years at which half of the cohort is retired. Uses s-curve-shutdown-decider function.
# steepness: Steepness of s-curve shutdown decider function
# median.shutdown.point: Profit-ratio ((revenue - costs) / costs) at which 50% of cohort is shut down by profit shutdown decider. Only variable costs.
# profit.shutdown.steepness: steepness of profit shutdown function
