# Title: Technology-level assumptions of regional natural gas markets (pipeline and LNG)
# Units: Various
# Comments: Natural gas uses infinite nesting subsectors. The nesting subsectors capture competition between domestic and imported natural gas; the subsector0 captures competition between LNG and pipeline gas; the technology captures the specific pipeline network that each region may be connected to. Technology interp rules for pipelines are overwritten in A21.stubtech_interp_R
#           half.life: number of years at which 50% of the base year cohort is retired; using the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           steepness: shape parameter used by the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           median.shutdown.point: profit-ratio at which 50% of the cohort is shut down for lack of profitability.
#           profit.shutdown.steepness: shape parameter of profit-shutdown-decider function.
