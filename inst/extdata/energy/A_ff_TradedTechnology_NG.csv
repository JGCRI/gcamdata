# Title: Technology-level assumptions of traded natural gas markets (LNG and pipeline gas)
# Units: Various
# Comments: For traded fuels each subsector has only one technology; there is no technology-level competition.
#           half.life: number of years at which 50% of the base year cohort is retired; using the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           steepness: shape parameter used by the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           median.shutdown.point: profit-ratio at which 50% of the cohort is shut down for lack of profitability.
#           profit.shutdown.steepness: shape parameter of profit-shutdown-decider function.
