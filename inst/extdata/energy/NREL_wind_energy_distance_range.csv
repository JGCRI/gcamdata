# Title: Numerical minimum and maximum in miles or nautical miles for NREL distance bins for both onshore and offshore wind
# Units: miles (onshore) and nautical miles (offshore)
# Comments: onshore distance -  near =  0-50 miles; transitional = 50-100 miles; far = 100-5000 miles; offshore distance - near <20 nautical miles; transitional = 20-50 nautical miles; far = 50-100 nautical miles
