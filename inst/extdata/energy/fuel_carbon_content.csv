# Title: Fuel carbon contents
# Units: kg carbon/kg fuel
# Description: a fractional value of carbon in the fuel to calculate energy density of the fuels
# Column types: cn
# Source: Coal data taken from Grammelis et al. 2016 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978178242378200002X)", crude oil value taken from encyclopedia britanica (https://www.britannica.com/science/crude-oil), natural gas value calculated assuming 100% of natural gas is CH4. Unconventional oil is traded after processing within GCAM," and so will be assumed to have the same carbon content as crude oil for trade.
