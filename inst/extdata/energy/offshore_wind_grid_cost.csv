# Title: Grid Connection Costs for Offshore Wind
# Units: cost_per_kW_km - 2013$/kW-km (2013 USD per kW of capacity and km from shore ); rep_dist_for_bin - km (representative distances for distance bins in km)
# Comments:  Calculated from data in NREL Wind Vision 2015 Report. Representative distances for bins are midpoints are on the basis of NREL's distance from shore bins in energy/NREL_offshore_energy.csv. Resources less than or equal to 70 km from shore face connection costs of 8.1$/kW-km; fesources greater than 70 km from shore face connection costs of 13.49$/kW-km.
