# Title: Current to Future Power Sector Technology Mapping
# Units: NA
# Comments: Mapping file between power sector generation technologies which don't exist historically (subsector) and 
# corresponding existing technologies (mapped_subsector).  Used to inform future cooling share assumptions for the former.
# For instance, cooling shares for nuclear Gen III in state X are assumed to be consistent with cooling technologies
# historically chosen for nuclear Gen II in that state.
