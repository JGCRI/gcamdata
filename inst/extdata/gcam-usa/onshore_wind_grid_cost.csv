# Title: Grid Connection Costs for Onshore Wind
# Units: $2010 USD per kW of capacity and km from grid (2010$/kW-km;Representative km value of distance bin at which cost is applicable
# Comments:  consistent with interconnection costs in CERF model (https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.227/); 774000 2010$/km per 251 MW wind farm (774000 / 251 / 1000 = 3.08 2010$ / kW-km). Distance based on reasonable representative points for existing distance bins onshore winds in NREL_onshore_energy.csv (see script for details)
