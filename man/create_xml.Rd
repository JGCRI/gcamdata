\usage{
create_xml(xml_file, mi_header = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xml_file}{The name to save the XML file to.}

\item{mi_header}{The model interface "header".  This will default to the one
included in this package.}
}
\value{
A "data structure" to hold the various parts needed to run the model
interface CSV to XML conversion.
}
\description{
The basis to define how to convert data to an XML file.  This method
simple requires the name to save the XML file as and optionally the
model interface "header" file that defines the transformation lookup
to go from tabular data to hierarchical.  The result of this should be
used in a dplyr pipeline with one or more calls to \code{\link{add_xml_data}}
to add the data to convert and finally ending with \code{\link{run_xml_conversion}}
to run the conversion.
