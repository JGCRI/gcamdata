\description{
Compute (1) feed by GCAM commodity, region, and year, and (2) net exports of FodderHerb.
}
\details{
Computes (1) feed by GCAM commodity, region, and year, and (2) net exports of FodderHerb.
The feed calculations combine IMAGE and FAO data together, using FAO to disaggregate IMAGE to GCAM_commodity.
Some adjustments are needed to deal with inconsistencies between IMAGE demand & FAO supply.
Excess supply is mapped to OtherUses. Excess demand is mapped to other sources (Residue, Pasture).
This information is used to calculate net exports of FodderHerb too.
