\description{
Calculates pasture and forests production, yields and managed land cover by GCAM region / GLU / year.
}
\details{
This chunk calculates pasture and forests production and yields by GCAM region / GLU / year,
and the managed pasture and forests land cover by GCAM region / GLU / historical year.
Managed land area for both are adjusted below the threshold percentage of total pasture and forest land,
and yields are increased so that production stays unchanged for those regions.
