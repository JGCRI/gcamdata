module_aglu_LB151.ag_MIRCA_ctry_C_GLU_irr(command, ...)

\arguments{
\item{command}{API command to execute}

\item{...}{other optional parameters, depending on command}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
the generated outputs: \code{L151.ag_irrHA_ha_ctry_crop}, \code{L151.ag_rfdHA_ha_ctry_crop}, \code{L151.ag_irrProd_t_ctry_crop}, \code{L151.ag_rfdProd_t_ctry_crop}. The corresponding file in the
original data system was \code{LB151.ag_MIRCA_ctry_C_GLU_irr.R} (aglu level1).

\description{
Separates country and harvested area into irrigated and rainfed by country, GLU, and GTAP_crop.

\details{
Separates country and harvested area into irrigated and rainfed by country, GLU, and GTAP_crop.
This chunk uses MIRCA irrigated and rainfed harvested area to separate harvested area from the LDS. This
is then combined with ratios of irrigated to rainfed yield from the FAO CROSIT database to compute
irrigated and rainfed production.
