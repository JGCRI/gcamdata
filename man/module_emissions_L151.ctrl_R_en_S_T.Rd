module_emissions_L151.ctrl_R_en_S_T(command, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{command}{API command to execute}

\item{...}{other optional parameters, depending on command}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
the generated outputs: \code{L151.nonghg_ctrl_R_en_S_T}. The corresponding file in the
original data system was \code{L151.ctrl_R_en_S_T.R} (emissions level1).

\description{
Compute maximum reduction by region / sector / gas.
}
\details{
Compute maximum reduction by region and sector for SO2, CO, NOx, NMVOC (all 2005 reference),
BC, and OC (2005). Reductions are limited to [0, 100]. EDGAR emissions inventory only goes up
to 2008, so for calculating emissions coefficients, 2005 is the final base year. These steps
calculate the "reduction" required to get from the 2005 observed emissions coefficients (for each
region / technology / emissions species) to the exogenous minimum coefficient for each
technology / emission species.
