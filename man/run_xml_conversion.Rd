\details{
Note that this method relies on Java to run the conversion.  To avoid errors for
users who do not have Java installed it will check the global option
\code{gcamdata.use_java} before attempting to run the conversion.  If the flag
is set to \code{FALSE} a warning will be issued and the conversion skipped.
To enable the use of Java a user can set \code{options(gcamdata.use_java=TRUE)}
