# USDA cost data is used to calculate total production costs - purchased irrigation water costs for
# GCAM commodities covered in USDA spreadsheets. This produces a commodity level water cost fraction for some
# but not all GCAM commodities. L161.ag_irr_HA_frac_R_C_GLU irrigated vs rainfed harvested area data for the
# covered GCAM commodities is used to form a linear model describing water cost fraction as a function of the
# irrigated fraction of harvested area. This linear model then predicts the water cost fraction based on
# irrigated fraction of harvested area for the missing commodities. Finally, cost data from LB133.ag_Cost_75USDkg_C
# is adjusted as LB133_cost * (1 - water cost fraction) = production cost - purchased irrigation water for each commodity.
