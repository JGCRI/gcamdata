# FLAG_PROTECT_FLOAT
# Imports equal mimus net exports when net exports are negative
# Imports are zero when net exports are positive
# Electricity net exports are calulated as total generation minus consumption and own use
# Cogeneration is included in total generation
# Net own use is calculated as total generation minus net outputs
# Consumption equals to the sum of input to the elect_td sectors
