title: Style Guide
---

Generally, we follow [Hadley Wickham's R style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).

Most importantly:
* Use `<-` for assignment, not `=`.
* Operators _do_ get spacing, parentheses do _not_: `if (x + 1) print("yes")`
* Use short, clear, and consistent variable names.
* [[Clearly comment your code and data|Documentation]].

### Standard R packages

We're using a standard set of R packages to handle many tasksâ€“mostly from what is known as the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org). These include:
* [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) for data manipulation and processing;
* [tidyr](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/02/02/tidyr-0-4-0/) for data reshaping;
* [assertthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/assertthat/index.html) for assertions;
* [tibble](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/24/tibble-1-0-0/) for better data frames;
* [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/README.html) for building pipelines.

### Pipelines

A word about pipelines: we aim to use these consistently and when it makes sense...but don't take things to extremes. Sometimes `y <- f(g(x))` really _is_ the clearest notation.

### Things NOT to use

The package tests will raise an error for all of these:
* R's `match()` function
* The `reshape` or `reshape2` packages (i.e. `melt` or `cast`)
* Loops (this is not an ironclad prohibition, but should be very rare)
* R's `ifelse` function - if necessary use `dplyr::if_else` instead
* Any of R's `apply` family of functions, `rowMeans`, etc. (again, with rare exceptions) 
* Successive `mutate()` calls. See [Hints for speed](speed_tips.html)
